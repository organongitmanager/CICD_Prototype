CICD Automated AWS Pipeline Prototype

# Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Expertise
Our experience with Open Source Software in AWS includes work in data mining with R Studio and various Python libraries to explore social/news/behavioral datasets using PCA, K-Means, Eigenvector, Bayesian, Factor-Discriminant, regression, regime-switching, and A/B Testing algorithms.  

For Accessibility and SEction 508 compliance we use JAWS, AXE, and Wave.  

In DEVSECOPS we have experience in CI/CD we have Git, TFS, SourceForge on solutions built with Angular 2, AngularJS, NodeJS, D3.js, JQuery, Bootstrap, Spark, and C#.
As part of our Prime contract at USDA, we provide oversight of ongoing Agile projects, evaluating sprint and scrum activities through version and project control elements such as Azure DEVOPS, and Microsoft SharePoint. SharePoint acts as a common repository for all project management artifacts and for each Release the suite of documents is updated. Each year an annual forecast of expected release specific functional domains and deliverables by Epic are identified. The resources and schedule are recorded in an online version of Microsoft Project for the CIO and leadership to track. When each release begins the results of sprint planning are entered TFS along with complexity, story points, and user stories that have been groomed and curated from a backlog. An example of our solution architecture integrating FOSS into DOD STIG servers with elements validated for Certificates of Networthiness.

## Agile DEVESECOPS Expertise
We map the requested system sets of features, functionality, and releases to material changes in enterprise architecture, security posture, and assurance levels. These are then presented and documented through Assessment, Certification, and Accreditation processes to result in System Security Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, and Incident Response Plan artifacts. There is also a Secure Code document that is used to track the results of all static code scanning results of all binaries prior to deployment in production.
